	<p class="intro">I am a second-year PhD student working with <a href="https://jhalderm.com">J. Alex Halderman</a> and <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a> at the University of Michigan.</p>

	<p>My research interests lie in the intersection of technology and society, particularly in the areas of privacy and security. I study topics such as Internet censorship, surveillance, usable privacy, and security education. I am also interested in comparing mental models of the Internet between the developers and users of technology, and the consequences disparities may have on how technology is used, perceived, and legislated.</p>

        <p>I was a <a href="https://studentawards.engin.umich.edu/fellowship/">Roger M Jones Fellow</a> at the European University Viadrina, and my experiences studying human rights law were chronicled on the <a href="https://rogermjones.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/meet-allison/">fellowship blog</a>.</p>
